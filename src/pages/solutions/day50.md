# Day 50

Lift($L$) can be determined by Lift Coefficient ($C_L$) like the following equation:

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L
$$

<!-- Testing a few things -->
$$
\begin{align}
y &= mx+b \\
  &= mx+b + 0
\end{align}
$$

Here is a `plain text` example:
```
This could be a code block
```

Here is a code block:
```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

And a Rust one:
```rs
fn is_happy(n: u32) -> bool {
    // exercise for reader...
    true
}
```
