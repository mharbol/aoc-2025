# Day 1
My solution is nothing too special.
I decided to not get fancy with the parser and just used the numbers' fixed lengths.
Part 1, sum the absolute differences in the sorted vectors.
Part 2 was a classic `map` scenario made easier by not needing to keep track of the numbers already counted.
C++ inserts a value not present in the map when using the bracket operator, that cleaned up the code a little when counting and summing.
