# Advent of Code - 2025
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) repo for [2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025/).
I am going all out this year by making this both an engineering/DevOps and programming project.

## Engineering/DevOps Part
Making the [Astro](https://astro.build) website and setting up the necessary automation pipelines to make the programming part in December nice and painless.

## Programming Part
Decided to do the programming portion in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).
While I am doubtful Rust will take over my area of the industry, I think there are some cool concepts involved in the language which I would like to explore.
Rust also compiles to [WASM](https://webassembly.org) fairly easily, so I will use that to make the solution functionality.
